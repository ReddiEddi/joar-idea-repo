# 10Ten: The Live Japanese Dictionary and more

### This paragraph will briefly describe some functions of 10Ten

10Ten started out as a pop-up dictionary with live definitions. It is generally used by most readers eho already know some Japanese and who have knowledge of how Japanese grammar and wordstucture works. Anyone without said knowledge would not find this tool usable as individual words or expressions are described or defines, and not entire sentences.

The main features which are usable are the following:
g
1.	Dictionary
	- Standard dictionary that can produce Ja-En definitions, but also Ja-Ja or JA to any other dictionary that can be installed.
	- Reading dictionary that informs how a given word is read including a pitch accent pattern. It also informs if there are multiple readings or different spellings and informs which ones are more common or standard.
	- Kanji dictionary with information of the desired kanji, including both the kunyomi and onyomi readings, as well as any name-only readings. It also includes the correct stroke order, potential meanings, included radicals and whether the kanji is included in various list or which level in the JLPT or Kanken the kanji is.
	- Names in Japan can be complicated as there are different spellings for the same name when it comes to pronunciation. This tool can indicate the various readings, whether a given reading is predominantly is a male or female name. In addition, if the reading (given and family name) of a famous person are hovered over, their romanised name and birthday are displayed.

2.	Conversion
	- Conversion of dates and year is a useful fuction. Japan uses both the international calendar as well as their own. The only difference is that year are counted based on the emperors' reign. the current year is reiwa 7. When hovered over with the extention which reads reiwa 7, it outputs 2025
	- Currency exchange is also implemented. If Â¥10,000 is marked in a text, one can hover the mouse over the amount, and it will give the amount in the selected currency. I have mine set to dkk, so it would convert it to 425.20 dkk.
	- Units of measurements which have historic meaning. Older texts may use older measurements such as shaku or sun. These would be converted by the add-on as well.

All in all, anyone who learns Japanese would greatly benefit from this add-on, as it maked the job of looking up words, kanji, and names as well as various Japanese converions much easier and much more streamlined.

When it comes to what is lacking, I caanot think what that would be. A few years ago, I wanted it to have pitch accent patterns, but that was implemented about 2 years ago. The addition of frequency lists may be helpful for some, but it is not a feature that I need right now as other software does that for me.
